This is the official repository for Pyramid Flow, a training-efficient **Autoregressive Video Generation** method based on **Flow Matching**. By training only on **open-source datasets**, it can generate high-quality 10-second videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS, and naturally supports image-to-video generation.

## Introduction

![motivation](assets/motivation.jpg)

Existing video diffusion models operate at full resolution, spending a lot of computation on very noisy latents. By contrast, our method harnesses the flexibility of flow matching ([Lipman et al., 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PqvMRDCJT9t); [Liu et al., 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XVjTT1nw5z); [Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=li7qeBbCR1t)) to interpolate between latents of different resolutions and noise levels, allowing for simultaneous generation and decompression of visual content with better computational efficiency. The entire framework is end-to-end optimized with a single DiT ([Peebles & Xie, 2023](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Peebles_Scalable_Diffusion_Models_with_Transformers_ICCV_2023_paper.html)), generating high-quality 10-second videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours.

## Usage

You can directly download the model from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/pyramid-flow-sd3). We provide both model checkpoints for 768p and 384p video generation. The 384p checkpoint supports 5-second video generation at 24FPS, while the 768p checkpoint supports up to 10-second video generation at 24FPS.

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

model_path = 'PATH'   # The local directory to save downloaded checkpoint
snapshot_download("rain1011/pyramid-flow-sd3", local_dir=model_path, local_dir_use_symlinks=False, repo_type='model')
```


To use our model, please follow the inference code in `video_generation_demo.ipynb` at [this link](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/blob/main/video_generation_demo.ipynb). We further simplify it into the following two-step procedure. First, load the downloaded model:

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
from pyramid_dit import PyramidDiTForVideoGeneration
from diffusers.utils import load_image, export_to_video

torch.cuda.set_device(0)
model_dtype, torch_dtype = 'bf16', torch.bfloat16   # Use bf16, fp16 or fp32	

model = PyramidDiTForVideoGeneration(
    'PATH',                                         # The downloaded checkpoint dir
    model_dtype,
    model_variant='diffusion_transformer_768p',     # 'diffusion_transformer_384p'
)

model.vae.to("cuda")
model.dit.to("cuda")
model.text_encoder.to("cuda")
model.vae.enable_tiling()
```

Then, you can try text-to-video generation on your own prompts:

```python
prompt = "A movie trailer featuring the adventures of the 30 year old space man wearing a red wool knitted motorcycle helmet, blue sky, salt desert, cinematic style, shot on 35mm film, vivid colors"

with torch.no_grad(), torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch_dtype):
    frames = model.generate(
        prompt=prompt,
        num_inference_steps=[20, 20, 20],
        video_num_inference_steps=[10, 10, 10],
        height=768,     
        width=1280,
        temp=16,                    # temp=16: 5s, temp=31: 10s
        guidance_scale=9.0,         # The guidance for the first frame
        video_guidance_scale=5.0,   # The guidance for the other video latent
        output_type="pil",
        save_memory=True,           # If you have enough GPU memory, set it to `False` to improve vae decoding speed
    )

export_to_video(frames, "./text_to_video_sample.mp4", fps=24)
```

As an autoregressive model, our model also supports (text conditioned) image-to-video generation:

```python
image = Image.open('assets/the_great_wall.jpg').convert("RGB").resize((1280, 768))
prompt = "FPV flying over the Great Wall"

with torch.no_grad(), torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch_dtype):
    frames = model.generate_i2v(
        prompt=prompt,
        input_image=image,
        num_inference_steps=[10, 10, 10],
        temp=16,
        video_guidance_scale=4.0,
        output_type="pil",
        save_memory=True,           # If you have enough GPU memory, set it to `False` to improve vae decoding speed
    )

export_to_video(frames, "./image_to_video_sample.mp4", fps=24)
```

Usage tips:

* The `guidance_scale` parameter controls the visual quality. We suggest using a guidance within [7, 9] for the 768p checkpoint during text-to-video generation, and 7 for the 384p checkpoint.
* The `video_guidance_scale` parameter controls the motion. A larger value increases the dynamic degree and mitigates the autoregressive generation degradation, while a smaller value stabilizes the video.
* For 10-second video generation, we recommend using a guidance scale of 7 and a video guidance scale of 5.

## Comparison

On VBench ([Huang et al., 2024](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vchitect/VBench_Leaderboard)), our method surpasses all the compared open-source baselines. Even with only public video data, it achieves comparable performance to commercial models like Kling ([Kuaishou, 2024](https://kling.kuaishou.com/en)) and Gen-3 Alpha ([Runway, 2024](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-gen-3-alpha)), especially in the quality score (84.74 vs. 84.11 of Gen-3) and motion smoothness.

We conduct an additional user study with 20+ participants. As can be seen, our method is preferred over open-source models such as [Open-Sora](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora) and [CogVideoX-2B](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo) especially in terms of motion smoothness.
